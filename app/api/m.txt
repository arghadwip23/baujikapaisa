Thank you, Your Honor.  May I call Mr. John Miller 
to the stand?


Mr. Miller, can you please describe your current 
living situation and why you believe it is in Erin’s best interest to be 
in your custody?

 So can it be concluded that  Erin needs to go with 
his father in order to ensure that he gets to grow in a healthy 
household ? 

I apologize, your honour. And that’s all 

 No, you honour, we believe we have provided 
enough evidence to show that Ms Laura could never provide a good 
home for Erin and she is only this enthusiastic in gaining custody is 
for the child support money that my client will be forced to pay to 
keep up with Ms Laura’s lavish lifestyle
